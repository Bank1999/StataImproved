## Multiple Instances of Stata
If you openned multiple instances of Stata, please note that this plugin will send the code to your MOST RECENTLY OPENNED Stata session. 


 
 
## Background information:
1, This plugin is motivated by the article ["Some notes on text editors for Stata users"](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html#vim) By Nicolas J. Cox, and some part of the code is motivated and modified based on following packages: [StataEditor](https://github.com/mattiasnordin/) for the auto-completion, and [StataEnhanced by Andrew Heiss] (https://github.com/andrewheiss/) for the AppleScript.
).

This plugin basically creates a temporary do-file, which is then sent to the Stata to execute. All temporary cache files will be removed shortly when you close the Stata session.


2, This package is the Mac only. For Windows users, please follow the instructions in the Nicolas J. Cox's webpage above.
 
        
3, This plugin has been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite, El Capitan and macOS, and supports Stata 13 and 14 SE/MP/IC.
