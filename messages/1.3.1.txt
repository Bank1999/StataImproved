Stata 15 introduced the markdown feature which allows one to convert their scripts into Word, PDF, or HTML files. (See http://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/markdown/)

Based on PJ Paul's comments, in this update, we provide the snippests for users to code the markdown script in ST3. 
We also provide the syntax highlighting for the Stata 15 markdown documents.

SETUP
1, In ST3, open/create a markdown script, which is normally a plain text file (e.g. txt). 
2, Navigate to: View > Syntax > Open all with current extension asâ€¦ > StataImproved > Stata".

USE THE SNIPPET
(i)
type dd_v for:
<<dd_version: ... >>
(ii)
type dd_dis for:
<<dd_display: %4.2f `....'>>
(iii)
type dd_do for:
<<dd_do>>

<</dd_do>>
(iv)
