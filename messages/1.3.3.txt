Stata 15 Markdown in ST3
-- Snippet and Syntax Highlighting
(v.1.3.2 - merged with PJ Paul's pull request)
*************************************

*******
 ABOUT
*******

Stata 15 introduced the Markdown feature. The Stata Markdown can transform the narrative text, code and outputs into a elegantly formatted document (e.g. Word, PDF, or HTML files).

(For more information about Stata Markdown, please see http://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/markdown/, or this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNry1vQiBxs )

Based on PJ Paul's comments, in this update, we provide the **snippests** for users to code the markdown script in ST3 efficiently. 

We also provide the **syntax highlighting** for the Stata Markdown documents.

*******
 SETUP
*******
1, In ST3, open/create a markdown script, which is normally a plain text file (e.g. txt). 
2, Navigate to: View > Syntax > Open all with current extension asâ€¦ > StataImproved > Stata".
